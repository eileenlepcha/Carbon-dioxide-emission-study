The agricultural CO2 emission dataset has been constructed by merging and reprocessing approximately a dozen individual datasets from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and data from IPCC. These datasets were, cleaned, pre-processed and merged together to create a comprehensive and cohesive dataset for analysis and forecasting purposes.
The dataset, as demonstrated in the notebook, describes CO2 emissions related to agro-food, which amount to approximately 62% of the global annual emissions.
Indeed, the emissions from the agro-food sector are significant when studying climate change. As the dataset shows, these emissions contribute to a substantial portion of the global annual emissions. Understanding and addressing the environmental impact of the agro-food industry is crucial for mitigating climate change and developing sustainable practices within this sector.

There are many factors that contribute to the yearly CO2 emissions such as industries, farming, fires, population, etc.
Our interest lies in sectors rather than their individual components, and their effect on the emissions. Which sector has the highest relationship with the CO2 emissions ? And If so can we use this relationship to create a regression.
For our project we have chosen to predict CO2 emissions from a chosen sector. We want to find the regression line that accurately predicts the CO2 emissions.
